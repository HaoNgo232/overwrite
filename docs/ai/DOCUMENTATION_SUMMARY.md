## 🎯 Key Decisions Summary

### Confirmed with Stakeholder:

1. ✅ **Max Depth**: Default 5 levels (configurable 0-20)
2. ✅ **Reverse Dependencies**: NOT implemented (forward deps only)
3. ✅ **Scoped Packages**: Include if in workspace
4. ✅ **Config Files**: Auto-select tsconfig.json, package.json
5. ✅ **Progress UI**: Progress bar with file count
6. ✅ **UI Placement**: Dual (Settings Tab + Context Tab)

### Technical Decisions:

1. ✅ **Algorithm**: BFS (better depth control than DFS)
2. ✅ **Parsing**: Hybrid regex + AST fallback
3. ✅ **Timing**: Eager analysis on user click
4. ✅ **Caching**: Aggressive caching for performance

---

- Include workspace scoped packages (@company/\*)
- Include config files (tsconfig.json, package.json)
- Toggle on/off in Settings + Context Tab
- Progress indicator for long operations
- Visual distinction between manual/auto selections

### Out of Scope ❌

- Reverse dependencies (who imports this file)
- Runtime dependency analysis
- Semantic code understanding
- Automatic refactoring
- Dependency graph visualization (future feature)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ⚡ **P95**: < 500ms for files with < 20 imports
- ⚡ **P99**: < 3s for complex files (50+ imports)
- 💾 **Memory**: < 50MB for dependency graph
- 🚀 **Scalability**: Works with 5,000+ file projects

### Quality Targets:

- 🧪 **Test Coverage**: 85%+ for all new code
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: Minimal false positives/negatives
- ⏱️ **Time Savings**: 80%+ reduction in manual selection time

### User Experience:

- 🎨 Clear visual feedback for auto-selections
- ⚙️ Easy configuration in Settings Tab
- 🔄 Quick toggle in Context Tab
- ⚠️ User-friendly error messages

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Start Implementation (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the execute-plan command to begin Task 1.1
/execute-plan
```

This will:

1. Guide you through each task in the planning doc
2. Track progress with checkboxes
3. Ensure implementation follows design
4. Update documentation as you go

### Option 2: Manual Implementation

If you prefer to implement manually:

**Week 1 - Foundation Services:**

1. Start with Task 1.1: Import Parser (4-6h)
2. Then Task 1.2: Path Resolver (4-5h)
3. Then Task 1.3: Exclusion Filter (3-4h)
4. Then Task 1.4: Graph Algorithms (3-4h)
5. Finally Task 1.5: Dependency Analyzer (6-8h)

Refer to `docs/ai/planning/feature-smart-file-selection.md` for detailed task descriptions.

### Option 3: Review Documentation First

If you want to review the docs before starting:

```bash
# Review requirements doc
/review-requirements docs/ai/requirements/feature-smart-file-selection.md

# Review design doc
/review-design docs/ai/design/feature-smart-file-selection.md
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Implementation

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with regex-based import parser, add AST later if needed
2. **Test Early**: Write unit tests alongside implementation, not after
3. **Cache Aggressively**: Performance depends heavily on caching
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Never let parsing failures crash the extension
5. **Profile Early**: Test with large codebases early to catch performance issues
6. **Document as You Go**: Update implementation doc with learnings

---

## 🎊 Ready to Begin!

All documentation is complete and approved. The feature is:

- ✅ **Well-defined** (clear requirements)
- ✅ **Well-designed** (solid architecture)
- ✅ **Well-planned** (realistic timeline)
- ✅ **Well-tested** (comprehensive test plan)

**Confidence Level**: HIGH 🚀

**Recommended Next Action**: Run `/execute-plan` to start Task 1.1 (Import Parser Service)

Good luck with implementation! 🎉
