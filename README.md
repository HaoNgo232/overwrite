## How to use

1. Open Overwrite from the Activity Bar.
2. In Explorer/Context, pick files and add your task instructions.
3. Click Copy Context (or Copy Context + XML Instructions) and paste into your LLM.
4. Paste the LLM XML response into Apply, preview diffs, then apply.

## Privacy & Telemetry

Overwrite includes **optional, anonymous telemetry** to help improve the extension. We collect usage patterns and performance metrics while maintaining strict privacy:

- **Anonymous data only** - No file paths, contents, or personal information
- **Transparent implementation** - All telemetry code is open source
- **Easy opt-out** - Disable via VS Code settings or extension preferences

For complete details, see [TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md).

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0+
