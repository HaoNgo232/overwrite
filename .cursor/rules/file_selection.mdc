# Rule: File Selection (Explorer Tab)

This rule describes the file selection process, primarily handled within the **Explorer Tab** of the extension's Webview Panel. See section 2.1 in [PRD.md](mdc:docs/prd.md).

## Key Features

*   **Activation:** Accessed via the extension's icon in the VS Code Activity Bar, which opens the Webview Panel defaulted to the Explorer Tab.
*   **Tree View Display:**
    *   Renders the workspace file/folder structure using the `<vscode-tree>` element from `@vscode-elements`.
    *   Located in `src/fileExplorerWebviewProvider.ts` which generates the HTML and handles tree data fetching.
    *   Respects common ignores (`.git`, `node_modules`, etc.).
*   **Selection Mechanism:**
    *   Uses actions (add/remove buttons) on tree items, managed in `media/webview.js`.
    *   Selection state (`selectedPaths` Set) is managed within the webview (`media/webview.js`).
    *   Selecting/deselecting folders cascades to children.
    *   Visual feedback (decorations 'F'/'H') indicates selection status.
*   **Search and Refresh:**
    *   A text input (`#search-input`) filters the tree view client-side (with debounce).
    *   A refresh button (`#refresh-button`) triggers a message (`getFileTree`) to the extension host (`src/fileExplorerWebviewProvider.ts`) to refetch the directory structure.
