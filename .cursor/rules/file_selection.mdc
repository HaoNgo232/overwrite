# File Selection Rule

This rule covers the file selection features in the VS Code extension, including displaying the workspace file tree with checkboxes, search/filter options, and refresh functionality (see [PRD.md](mdc:docs/PRD.md)).

## Key Features
- **Activity Bar Integration:** Add an icon to the VS Code Activity Bar for accessing the file tree view.
- **Tree View Display:** Show the file and folder structure, allowing expansion/collapsing and respecting `.gitignore` or `files.exclude` settings.
- **Selection Mechanism:** Use checkboxes to select files or folders, with implicit selection of subitems in folders and persistence across sessions.
- **Search and Refresh:** Include a search bar for filtering and a refresh button to update the tree.
