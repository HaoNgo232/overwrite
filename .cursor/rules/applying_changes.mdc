# Applying Changes Rule

This rule details the process for applying LLM-suggested changes in the VS Code extension, including parsing XML responses and executing file actions (see [PRD.md](mdc:docs/PRD.md)).

## Key Features
- **Input for LLM Response:** Provide a textarea for pasting XML-formatted responses.
- **Parsing Logic:** Extract and parse `<file>` tags with attributes like `path` and `action`, including `<search>` and `<content>` blocks.
- **File Actions:** Implement create, rewrite, modify, and delete operations using VS Code APIs, with error handling and feedback via notifications.
- **Preview and Apply:** Include a button for previewing and applying changes, ensuring integration with VS Code's diff and undo features.
